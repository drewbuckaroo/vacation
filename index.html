      <h2>Vacation is all I ever wanted</h2>
      <p>
        Can't seem to get my mind off of you
        Back here at home there's nothin' to do
        Now that I'm away
        I wish I'd stayed
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>Tomorrow's a day of mine that you won't be in
      When you looked at me I should've run
      But I thought it was just for fun
      I see I was wrong
      And I'm not so strong
      I should've known all along that time would tell
    </p>
    <p>
      A week without you
      Thought I'd forget
      Two weeks without you and I
      Still haven't gotten over you yet
    </p>

        Vacation, all I ever wanted
        Vacation, had to get away
        Vacation, meant to be spent alone
        Vacation, all I ever wanted
        Vacation, had to get away
        Vacation, meant to be spent alone
        A weekâ€¦
